Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the price of cars based on their features using machine learning.

Overview

The idea is simple: given details like car brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and other attributes, the model learns patterns from historical data and predicts a fair price for a car. This can be useful for buyers, sellers, or dealerships who want a quick estimate.

Dataset

The dataset used is car data.csv, which contains various car attributes such as:

Brand/Model

Year of manufacture

Present price

Kms driven

Fuel type

Seller type

Transmission

Owner history

How It Works

Load and clean the dataset.

Perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the features.

Train machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Evaluate performance using accuracy metrics.

Use the trained model to predict car prices for new inputs.

Requirements

Python 3.x

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)

You can install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Clone the repo / download the files.

Make sure car data.csv is in the project folder.

Run the notebook or script to train and test the model.

Input car details to get a predicted price.
